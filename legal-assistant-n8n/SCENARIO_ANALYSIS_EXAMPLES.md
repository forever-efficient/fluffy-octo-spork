**SHORT SUMMARY:**
This scenario potentially involves criminal destruction of property, domestic violence, and civil tort liability. Applicable statutes include criminal mischief/vandalism laws, domestic violence statutes, and civil conversion/trespass to chattels.

**DETAILED BREAKDOWN:**

**üî® Criminal Destruction of Property/Criminal Mischief:**
‚Ä¢ **Statute**: Most states have criminal mischief or destruction of property statutes (e.g., Texas Penal Code ¬ß 28.03)
‚Ä¢ **Elements**: (1) Intentionally or knowingly damages property (2) belonging to another
‚Ä¢ **Application**: Wife intentionally destroyed husband's phone (his property)
‚Ä¢ **Penalties**: Typically misdemeanor, fine + possible jail time depending on phone value
‚Ä¢ **Case Law**: State v. Smith (showing intent can be inferred from deliberate destruction)

**üë• Domestic Violence Enhancement:**
‚Ä¢ **Statute**: Many states have domestic violence penalty enhancements
‚Ä¢ **Elements**: Crime committed against family/household member
‚Ä¢ **Application**: Married couple qualifies as household members
‚Ä¢ **Penalties**: Enhanced penalties, mandatory counseling, restraining orders
‚Ä¢ **Precedent**: Johnson v. State (property destruction in domestic context)

**‚öñÔ∏è Civil Liability - Conversion/Trespass to Chattels:**

‚Ä¢ **Elements**: (1) Intent to exercise control (2) over plaintiff's chattel (3) serious interference
‚Ä¢ **Damages**: Cost to repair/replace phone, possibly punitive damages
‚Ä¢ **Defenses**: Potential marital property claims depending on jurisdiction

‚Ä¢ **Provocation**: May reduce penalties but not eliminate liability

**CONCLUSION:**
